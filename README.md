# Portfolio shortcut
Hello, this is a simple explanation of this work intended for my portfolio.
My name is Gonçalo Carneiro and as you can see I was the team leader.
This project was for a master curriculum unit when I was still in my second year of my bachelor's degree, and was created with<br>
the help of Chinese students, making it an international experience that I will never forget.
This happened because I asked for something more and got a bag full of stress and experience :)
The goal was to simulate a real job proposal for the production of an app that refers customers to partner companies, supported by an AI.
There were 5 teams for the 5 parts:
- 3 for the frontend (web, android and wechat)
- 2 for the backend (database and AI)
I was very hopeful and super excited, but I had no idea how much work was needed!
Still, I believe I was able to keep the boat afloat by making sure the work got done, with or without help. I always tried to have<br>
the vision to consider the user experience so that I could improve the work of all teams.

Even though it was very stressful, it showed me what I can do as a team leader and I proved to myself that I can do amazing things<br>
even when agains the odds.

The repository above only has our part of the project.
