# Backrooms_dsd2024
Hi there, welcome to the new and (totally) not improved BACKROOMS, where all of us come to get lost and lose touch with reality.
This starts as a project between two wonderful Universities, UTAD and JLU, to create an APP that will approach stores and clients in a fun and exciting way.
We are hoping to recruit more JLU students, to complet this wonderful team and show the other groups how much OverPower we are compared to them, MUAHAHAHAHA!!!
Just kidding! Let's have fun, learn a lot, and be proud of our work. FULL POWER!
